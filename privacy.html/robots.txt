            <p>Thank you for using GA4 Optimizer (the "Extension"), a free tool created by an individual developer to help Google Analytics users speed up their insight gathering. Your privacy is very important to us. This policy outlines how the Extension handles information.</p>

            <h3>1. About This Extension & Your Privacy</h3>
            <p>GA4 Optimizer is a free Chrome extension created by an individual developer to help you work more efficiently with Google Analytics 4.</p>
            <p>Your privacy is the top priority. This Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data or your Google Analytics data. All operations are performed locally within your browser.</p>

            <h3>2. Information We Don't Collect</h3>
            <p>To be clear, the Extension does not access or handle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal information (name, email, IP address, etc.).</li>
                <li>Your Google Analytics account data.</li>
                <li>Your general browsing history.</li>
                <li>Analytics about your use of the Extension itself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How the Extension Uses Information Locally (On Your Computer)</h3>
            <p>The Extension primarily uses information locally on your device to provide its features and save your preferences. This information never leaves your computer via the Extension.</p>
            <p><strong>Settings Storage (Client-Side):</strong> The Extension uses your browser's local storage (<code>chrome.storage.sync</code>) to save your preferences. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which features of the Extension you have enabled or disabled (e.g., "Percentage of Column Total," "Sticky Report Header").</li>
                <li>The screen position of the "Sticky CR Calculator" widget, if you move it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is stored locally on your computer and may be synced by Chrome if you have browser sync enabled. This is a standard browser feature, and the developer does not have access to this synced data. This data is not sent to the developer or any third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>Real-time Page Interaction:</strong> To make its features work (like calculating percentages or making headers sticky), the Extension interacts with the content of the Google Analytics 4 pages you are currently viewing. This interaction is all done locally within your browser and is not stored or transmitted.</p>
            <p><strong>Clipboard Access:</strong> The "Click to Copy Cell" feature requires permission to write to your clipboard. This is solely to allow you to copy text directly from the Google Analytics interface as initiated by your clicks. No data is sent to the developer or any third parties through this feature.</p>

            <h3>4. Permissions We Use</h3>
            <p>The Extension requests the following permissions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your feature preferences locally, as described in Section 3.</li>
                <li><strong>tabs:</strong> To interact with your active Google Analytics tab (e.g., for features to work on the page, for the popup to communicate with the page, or to reload the tab if you use the popup button).</li>
                <li><strong>clipboardWrite:</strong> For the "Click to Copy Cell" feature described in Section 3.</li>
                <li><strong>Host Permissions:</strong> <code>https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/*</code> is essential for the Extension to operate on Google Analytics 4 pages. The <code>web_accessible_resources</code> setting in the manifest also uses this match to ensure the Extension's packaged help and onboarding pages can be opened correctly in your browser.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>Since no personal data is collected by the developer, no data is shared with or sold to any third parties.</p>

            <h3>6. User Control Over Data</h3>
            <p>The settings and operational data used by the Extension reside entirely on your local computer (and potentially synced via your Chrome browser settings). You can clear settings data stored by the extension by uninstalling the Extension, which removes locally stored settings associated with it.</p>

            <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy covers the GA4 Optimizer Extension. Your use of the Google Chrome Web Store is subject to Google's privacy policies, and your use of Google Analytics (including related services like Google Tag Manager) is subject to Google's privacy policies and terms of service.</p>

            <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your jurisdiction).</p>

            <h3>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

            <h3>10. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the Extension's practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:optimizerga@gmail.com">optimizerga@gmail.com</a>.</p>
