            <h1>Privacy Policy for GA4 Optimizer</h1>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 8, 2025</p>

            <p>Thank you for using GA4 Optimizer (the "Extension"), a free tool created by an individual developer to help Google Analytics users speed up their insight gathering. Your privacy is very important to us. This policy outlines how the Extension handles information.</p>

            <h3>1. About This Extension & Your Privacy</h3>
            <p>GA4 Optimizer is a free Chrome extension created by an individual developer to help you work more efficiently with Google Analytics 4. Your privacy is the top priority. This Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data or your Google Analytics data. All operations are performed locally within your browser.</p>

            <h3>2. Information We Don't Collect</h3>
            <p>To be clear, the Extension does not access or handle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal information (name, email, IP address, etc.).</li>
                <li>Your Google Analytics account data.</li>
                <li>Your general browsing history.</li>
                <li>Analytics about your use of the Extension itself.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How the Extension Uses Information Locally</h3>
            <p>The Extension primarily uses information locally on your device to provide its features and save your preferences. This information never leaves your computer via the Extension.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Settings Storage (Client-Side):</strong> The Extension uses <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> to save your preferences, such as which features are enabled and the position of the sticky calculator. This data is stored locally on your computer and is not sent to the developer.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Page Interaction:</strong> To make its features work, the Extension interacts with the content of the GA4 pages you are currently viewing. This interaction is all done locally within your browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Clipboard Access:</strong> The "Click to Copy Cell" feature requires permission to write to your clipboard, solely to allow you to copy text as initiated by your clicks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Permissions We Use</h3>
            <p>The Extension requests the following permissions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your feature preferences locally.</li>
                <li><strong>tabs:</strong> To interact with your active Google Analytics tab.</li>
                <li><strong>clipboardWrite:</strong> For the "Click to Copy Cell" feature.</li>
                <li><strong>Host Permissions (<code>https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/*</code>):</strong> Essential for the Extension to operate on Google Analytics 4 pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>Since no personal data is collected by the developer, no data is shared with or sold to any third parties.</p>

            <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.</p>
