Analyzing the results of an A/B test in Google Analytics 4 can be a cumbersome process. You have to build comparisons in Explorations, export the data to a spreadsheet, and then manually run calculations for statistical significance. It's slow and leaves room for error.

What if you could get all the critical results, including statistical confidence, directly inside your GA4 report?

### The Problem: Manual, Time-Consuming Analysis

In a standard GA4 Exploration report, comparing your test variation against your control group gives you basic metrics, but it doesn't answer the most important question: **"Is this result statistically significant?"**

You're left wondering if the observed lift is a real effect or just random chance. To find out, you have to:

1.  Export the user and conversion counts.
2.  Paste them into an online significance calculator or a custom spreadsheet.
3.  Check for Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) to ensure your test was valid.

This process is a major workflow interruption.

### The Solution: Instant A/B Test Analysis with GA4 Optimizer

The **AB Test Segment Comparison** feature in GA4 Optimizer completely automates this analysis.

<!-- THIS IS THE NEW VIDEO BLOCK -->
<div class="feature-video-container" data-video-name="ABTestCompare" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 20px auto;">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
        <source src="/mp4/ab_test_compare.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <div class="play-icon-overlay"></div>
</div>

By simply naming your segments correctly (e.g., `VAR-Control`, `VAR-Variation 1`), the extension automatically enhances your Exploration report with the data you actually need:

*   **Conversion Rate (CR):** Calculates the conversion rate for each variation.
*   **Uplift vs. Control:** Shows the percentage lift in conversion rate compared to the control group.
*   **Confidence (Statistical Significance):** Tells you the probability that the observed result is real and not due to random chance. It automatically highlights results above 95% confidence.
*   **Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) Check:** Instantly validates your test's integrity.

This turns a 15-minute data-exporting task into a 5-second glance, allowing you to make faster, more confident decisions about your optimization efforts.
