description: Stop wasting time with GA4's clunky interface. Learn a faster
  workflow to create insightful Month-over-Month reports with one-click presets,
  sticky headers, and more.
---

It's the first week of the month, and the reporting requests are coming in. "How did our traffic from last month compare to the month before?" "What were the biggest channel changes, year-over-year?" These are basic questions, but answering them in Google Analytics 4 often feels like a chore.

The default interface is powerful but requires a frustrating number of clicks for even simple comparisons. You lose your place scrolling through long reports, and the raw percentage changes often lack the context you need to make smart decisions.

Here is a faster, more insightful workflow using a few key features from the GA4 Optimizer extension.

### The Standard GA4 Reporting Problem

Out of the box, a typical MoM comparison involves:
1.  \*\*Tedious Date Selection:\*\* Seven clicks to select a start date, end date, comparison start date, and comparison end date.
2.  \*\*Losing Context:\*\* Scrolling down a long report to see a specific channel, only to lose track of which percentage column is which.
3.  \*\*Manual Calculations:\*\* Seeing a big swing in revenue and users, then having to open a separate calculator to figure out the impact on your Cost Per Acquisition (CPA).
4.  \*\*"Percentage Blindness":\*\* Seeing dozens of green and red percentage changes, making it hard to spot the \*truly\* significant trends at a glance.

Let's fix all of that.

### The Optimizer Reporting Workflow

#### Step 1: Get Your Comparison in Two Clicks

Instead of manually selecting four different dates, the \*\*Data Range Presets\*\* feature adds one-click buttons directly into the GA4 date picker.

\*   Simply click \*\*"Last month"\*\*.
\*   Then check the "Compare" box and click \*\*"Previous period (Month-over-Month)"\*\*.

What took seven clicks now takes two. This works for any common range, including Week-over-Week and Year-over-Year, saving you time on every single report you pull.

#### Step 2: Keep Your Headers Visible, Always

Once your report loads, activate the \*\*Sticky Report Header\*\*. As you scroll down to analyze channels far down the list, the header row (\`Users\`, \`Sessions\`, \`Conversions\`, \`% change\`) remains locked at the top of the screen. You never have to scroll back up to remember which column you're looking at.

#### Step 3: Instantly Spot Significant Trends

Your report is now full of percentage changes. To cut through the noise, the \*\*Percentage Change Highlighter\*\* uses conditional formatting to make significant trends jump off the page.

Large positive changes are highlighted in green, and large negative changes in red. This immediately draws your eye to the biggest wins and potential problems, helping you focus your analysis on what actually matters.

#### Step 4: Perform Quick Math Without Leaving the Page

You notice that your ad spend went up by 20%, but conversions only went up by 10%. What did that do to your CPA?

Instead of opening a new tab, just open the \*\*Sticky Conversion Calculator\*\*. It's always available on the side of your screen. You can perform quick calculations like conversion rate, cost per click, or return on ad spend without ever interrupting your workflow, allowing you to get deeper insights in real-time.

### A Smarter, Not Harder, Approach

By combining these four simple features, you can transform your standard reporting process in GA4 from a clunky, multi-minute task into a streamlined, 30-second workflow. This gives you more time to do what's important: analyzing the data, not fighting the interface.
