  not 'Exit Rate'? Learn how to create custom calculated metrics on-the-fly
  without leaving the page.

You've meticulously built a "Pages and screens" report in Google Analytics 4. You add the `Views` metric. You add the `Exits` metric. You scan the table, looking for that one crucial diagnostic number to identify which pages are losing visitors... but it's not there. Where is the **Exit Rate**?

It’s one of the most common frustrations with GA4’s standard reports. The raw ingredients are right in front of you, but the final dish is missing. The official answer usually involves exporting your data to a spreadsheet or building a far more complex Looker Studio report.

But what if you could get the answer in 30 seconds without ever leaving the report you're already in?

## The Problem: The Three Bad Options for a Simple Rate

In Universal Analytics, Exit Rate was a standard, out-of-the-box metric. In GA4, its absence from default reports forces you down one of three frustrating paths for what should be a simple health check:

1. **The Spreadsheet Detour:** You export the entire report to Google Sheets or Excel. You create a new column, write the formula `=Exits/Views`, format it as a percentage, and drag it down. It works, but it's slow, manual, and completely outside of your analytics workflow.
2. **Looker Studio Dashboard:** You can abandon the simple standard report and complicate it by attempting to manually build your own dashboard in Looker Studio where you calculate Exits/Views. But this is complicated and again take you out of the Google Analytics workflow.
3. **The "Good Enough" Guess:** You eyeball the `Views` and `Exits` numbers and try to mentally estimate the ratio, promising yourself you'll "do a deep dive later." This often leads to missed insights and opportunities.

None of these options are efficient. They disrupt your flow and discourage the kind of quick, iterative analysis that uncovers real opportunities.

## The Solution: Create Calculations On-the-Fly, Anywhere

The **Quick Calculated Metric** feature in our free [GA4 Optimizer Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ga4-optimizer/hlldjkhoepkephgaeifgbelgchncfnjj?utm_source=gaoptimizer.com&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=blog_exit_rate_guide) is designed to solve this exact problem. It adds the functionality you need directly into the GA4 interface, whether you're in a Standard Report or an Exploration. **You can now save your Exit Rate calculation to your personal library and choose to auto-apply it in Standard Reports, Explorations, or both.**

### Method 1: Adding a Column in Standard Reports

This is the most direct fix. The feature adds a new, interactive column directly to your report table.

1. **Open Your Report:** Go to any Standard Report that contains your base metrics (e.g., a "Pages and screens" report with `Views` and `Exits`). The extension automatically adds a new, empty column.
2. **Add Calculation:** Click the `+ Add calculated rate` button inside the new column's header.
3. **Define Your Rate:** A modal pops up.

   * Set **Numerator** to `Exits`.
   * Set **Denominator** to `Views`.
   * Set **Display Format** to `Percentage`.
   * **Optionally, check "Save this calculated rate"** to add it to your library for future use.
4. **Click Apply.**

<div class="feature-video-container" data-video-name="QuickCalculatedMetric" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 25px auto;">
    <video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
        <source src="/mp4/quick_calculated_metric.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <div class="play-icon-overlay"></div>
</div>

Instantly, the new column populates with the **Exit Rate** for every single row, including totals and comparison rows. No exports, no new tabs, no rebuilding reports. **If you saved the calculation, it will be available in your settings library and can be set to auto-apply in future reports.**

### Method 2: Enhancing Tooltips in Explorations

Even in Explorations where you *can* build calculated metrics, doing so permanently isn't always ideal for a quick check. Our feature offers a faster alternative that can be either temporary or saved for reuse.

1. **Right-Click the Header:** In your Exploration table, **right-click** on the header of the metric you want to use as your numerator (e.g., `Exits`).
2. **Configure:** In the Optimizer menu that appears, choose to create a new calculation. A modal will pop up allowing you to select the **Denominator** (e.g., `Views`), format, and optionally save the calculation to your library.
3. **Analyze on Hover:** Now, simply hover over any `Exits` value in the table. The tooltip will automatically show you the calculated **Exit Rate** for that specific row, without you having to add another column to your report. **All saved metrics set to auto-apply in Explorations will appear automatically if their numerator and denominator are present.**

This lets you perform quick, contextual analysis directly inside your most complex reports.

## What to Look For: Interpreting Exit Rate

Once you have the Exit Rate, the next step is to understand what it's telling you. A "high" exit rate isn't always bad—it depends entirely on the page's purpose.

* **High Exit Rate is OK here:**

  * **Thank You / Confirmation Pages:** A user has just completed a purchase or form. Leaving from this page is expected and normal.
  * **Contact Us / Support Pages:** The user found the information they needed (an address, a phone number) and is now leaving.
  * **Blog Posts (to a degree):** A user might read an article and leave satisfied. However, a very high exit rate could mean you're failing to guide them to other relevant content.
* **High Exit Rate is a RED FLAG here:**

  * **Shopping Cart / Checkout Funnel:** A high exit rate on any step before the final "thank you" page indicates a serious problem. Users are abandoning their purchase due to cost, complexity, or technical issues.
  * **Multi-Step Forms:** If users are dropping off in the middle of a sign-up or lead generation form, it's likely too long or asks for confusing information.
  * **Key Landing Pages:** If a page designed to drive users deeper into your site has a high exit rate, the call-to-action may be weak or the content might not match the user's expectation from the ad or link they clicked.

By using the Quick Calculated Metric to instantly see Exit Rate, you can spend less time wrestling with reports and more time analyzing these user journeys and fixing the leaks that are costing you conversions.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**Q: How do you calculate Exit Rate in a GA4 report?**
A: Exit Rate is calculated as Exits ÷ Views for a specific page. While GA4 contains these base metrics, it does not provide a ready-made Exit Rate column in its standard reports. To see it, users typically have to export data or if you have the technical expertise build it in Looker Studio. A faster method is to use a tool like the GA4 Optimizer extension, which lets you create a 'Quick Calculated Metric' on-the-fly in both Standard Reports and Explorations. You can save your Exit Rate calculation to your personal library and choose to auto-apply it in future reports.

**Q: How do you find which pages have a high Exit Rate in GA4?**
A: To find pages with a high Exit Rate, you must first calculate the metric, typically within a 'Pages and screens' report. Since this is not a default metric, you can use our GA4 Optimizer extension to add the calculation directly to a standard report. Once calculated, you can sort the report by Exit Rate to identify the top problem pages. The extension also allows you to save this calculation for automatic use in future reports.

**Q: What's the difference between Exit Rate and Bounce Rate in GA4?**
A: Exit Rate is page-specific: it’s the percentage of times a page was the last one viewed in a session (Exits / Views). A high exit rate on a 'thank you' page is normal, but on a checkout page, it could indicate a problem. Bounce Rate is session-specific: it’s the percentage of sessions that were not 'engaged' (e.g., lasted under 10 seconds, had no conversion, and had fewer than 2 pageviews). It signals that a user arrived and left without meaningful interaction.
